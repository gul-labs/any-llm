Every result carries the ordered assistant `message` and a `continuation` rule, `AdapterResult.message` is required, and provider state is scoped to its provider and model string (ADR-029 addendum).

- **`LlmResult.message`** is the assistant output as an ordered `Message` on every provider: text parts and tool calls in provider order, thought, reasoning and server-tool items omitted. `text` and `toolCalls` stay as conveniences; `result.toolCalls` is a copy, so editing a tool call's `args` no longer changes the arguments in `result.message` (which a Gemini 3 signature hashes). A result with nothing representable (a thought-only response whose output cap went to reasoning) has `message.parts === []`: do not append it to history. An assistant message with no parts is `bad_request` before dispatch, on every provider.
- **`AdapterResult.message` is required.** The engine no longer builds it from `text` and `toolCalls`, because only the adapter knows the provider's interleaving. The Google, xAI, Claude CLI and Codex CLI adapters set it, and `FakeAdapter` and `SignalAwareFakeAdapter` throw a `TypeError` for a scripted result that lacks it.
- **`LlmResult.continuation`** (`'history' | 'state'`) repeats the descriptor's new `capabilities.continuation`. `'history'` (the default, and grok-4.5/4.6): append `result.message` and send the full history. `'state'` (grok-4.7): send only the new messages plus `result.transientProviderState` and do not replay `result.message`. `capabilities.statelessReasoningReplay` is deleted; `capabilities.providerState: true` is what lets the engine forward `transientProviderState` (`createModelRegistry` rejects `continuation: 'state'` without it).
- **State is provider-scoped and bound to the model string the host sent.** The xAI state is `{ xai: { model, input } }` (it was `{ model, input }`), and `XaiReplayState` has that shape. Another provider's state, or state bound to another model string (an alias is a different string from its canonical id), is `bad_request`; the next turn uses the same `provider` and `model` string as the previous one (`result.model` is the id the provider returned and is not for routing).
- **`TokenCount.accuracy`** gains `'estimated'`: the provider counted the history, but the real call sends parts the count cannot include. `@gullabs/google` reports it for a Gemini 3 history that holds function calls. `AdapterCtx.modelDescriptor` carries the resolved descriptor to `countTokens`.
- **`@gullabs/testing`** adds `runToolLoop(client, req, tools, { auth })`, which follows `result.continuation` after every turn, turns a throwing tool into an `isError` tool result, rejects a call to a tool with no own implementation (a model call named `toString` is a missing tool) with `bad_request`, and rejects a `maxTurns` that is not an integer of at least 1.

What hosts must change:

- A custom `ProviderAdapter` (and any scripted `FakeAdapter` result) returns `message: { role: 'assistant', parts }`. Read `result.continuation`, or follow the README loops, instead of assuming one replay rule.
- Do not append a result whose `message.parts` is empty to your history; retry the call. Code that switches on `TokenCount.accuracy` handles `'estimated'`.
- Persist grok-4.7 state exactly as returned; state stored in the old `{ model, input }` shape is rejected, so restart those conversations.
- A custom `ModelDescriptor` that declared `statelessReasoningReplay: true` declares `continuation: 'state', providerState: true` instead.
